# RootMe_challenges
This repository allow me to improve and show my abilities on different challenges which came from the "Root Me" website.

## What is Root Me ?
It is a website made to learn computer security by displaying "legal hacking challenges". One other goal is to show how weak some system could be.  
  
**Notice that all provided web servers are made for that purpose**
